  In addition to the pre-college exhibition, I came across several books that influenced me to love statistics. :heartpulse:
  
  My favorite book: [The Drunkard's Walk](https://www.amazon.com.br/Drunkards-Walk-Randomness-Rules-English-ebook/dp/B001NXK1XO/ref=sr_1_1?adgrpid=1152288844508110&hvadid=72018139419287&hvbmt=be&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=147508&hvnetw=o&hvqmt=e&hvtargid=kwd-72018570122560%3Aloc-20&hydadcr=5744_11235378&keywords=the+drunkard+%27s+walk+how+randomness+rules+our+lives&qid=1706452305&sr=8-1) by Leonard Mlodinow. This was the first book I read about How Randomness Rules Our Lives and how it influences us in decision-making.
  
  My second favorite book is one of the classics of statistics. [The Lady Tasting Tea:](https://www.amazon.com/Lady-Tasting-Tea-Statistics-Revolutionized/dp/0805071342) How Statistics Revolutionized Science in the Twentieth Century by David Salsburg. After this book, the importance of statistics in my life changed forever. It was from him that I decided to take the statistics course.
  
  And my third favorite book is [The Black Swan](https://www.amazon.com.br/Black-Swan-Impact-Highly-Improbable/dp/1400063515): The Impact of the Highly Improbable by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. The book talk about advanced concepts in statics but in a simplist way.
