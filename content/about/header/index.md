<!-- this is a subheadline -->

I am a student of the Statistics course at the University of Rio Grande do Sul -UFRGS

My passion for statistics came long before I started college. In 2020, when I did an internship, I came into contact with some articles that made me enter the world of statistics.

In college, the pleasure of studying calculus, linear algebra and inference made me like the course even more and want to develop myself in tools focused on statistical analysis such as `R`, `SQL` and `Python` (even though R is still my true passion)
